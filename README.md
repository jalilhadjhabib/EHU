# Web Project - CESI EXIA 2nd Year Internship

This GitHub repository holds the work accomplished during my second year of Computer Science studies at CESI EXIA School as part of my internship web development project.

## Project Context

As part of my studies at CESI EXIA, I undertook an internship at EHU University Hospital. My main mission was to develop a new website for the hospital, enhancing the existing one with additional sections and functionalities to provide a better experience for visitors. The website was developed using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Laravel, with a specific focus on using Easy!Appointments for online appointment scheduling.

## Repository Content

This repository includes the codebase for the web application. The comprehensive project report, SQL scripts for setting up the database, front-end designs and wireframes, unit tests for validating the application's functionality, and legal considerations for the application are all encompassed within the code and its documentation.

## Team Members

**HADJHABIB Abdel Djalil**: Intern responsible for the project, in charge of task distribution and coordination.

## Conclusion

This project was immensely enriching, allowing me to explore the practical application of web development skills in a real-world context and to collaborate with a team on a complex task. The end result is a modern website with enhanced features, such as an integrated online appointment scheduling system using Easy!Appointments, making it more dynamic and user-friendly.

This repository represents an example of my work during my second year at CESI EXIA, showcasing my abilities in web development and project management.
